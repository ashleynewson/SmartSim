SmartSim
========

SmartSim is a package designed to allow the easy design and testing
of electronic logic circuits via the process of simulation. Some common
supported features include:

 - **Subcircuit Integration** - design circuits with your own, custom subcircuits
 - **Interactive Simulation** - interact extensively with a live, running simulation
	to allow the testing of interactive and/or advanced devices
 - **Timing Records** - create logic timing diagrams directly from a simulation
 - **Simulated Memory** - create circuits with loadable and saveable RAM and/or ROM.
 - **Diagram Export** - export your design or timing diagram in any of the following formats:
   - `SVG` (scales flawlessly: for when you want to send or post crisp, clear images)
   - `PNG` (scales with loss of quality: mainly for embedding into other documents)
   - `PDF` (does not easily scale: preapring for publishing and/or printing)
